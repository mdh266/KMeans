# Writing A Scikit Learn Compatible Clustering Algorithm
-----------------------

## About
---------
In this post, I will go over how to write a K-means clustering algorithm from scratch using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). The algorithm will be explained in the next section and while seamingly simple, it can be tricky to implement efficiently! As an added bonus, I will go over how to implement a [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) compatible clustering algorithm so that we can using Scikit-Learn's framework including [Pipelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) and [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html).
